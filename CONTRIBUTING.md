# Contributing Guide


Contributions to this project are always welcome. You make our lives easier by
sending us your contributions through pull requests.

Pull requests for bug fixes must be based on the current stable branch whereas
pull requests for new features must be based on `master`.


(Contributions on wording & style are also welcome.)


## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

In order to accept your pull request, we need you to [submit a CLA](http://linkeddata.center/help/legal/cla_v1) to admin@linkeddata.center. You only need to do this once, so if you've done this for another LinkedData.Center open source project, you're good to go. If you are submitting a pull request for the first time, just let us know that you have completed the CLA and we can cross-check with your GitHub username.
